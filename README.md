# rtw88 downstream 🐧
### This is a downstream repo with a primary purpose of supporting development, testing and maintenance for the Realtek rtw88 series of WiFi 5 drivers in the Linux kernel.

The most recent addition to this repo is the driver for the RTL8814AU chipset. Testing is needed so if you have an adapter based on the RTL8814AU chipset, please test and report.

Update: There is now also a driver for RTL8814AE PCIe cards, ID 10ec:8813. lspci may call it RTL8813AE, same thing. Please test and report if you still have this card.

🌟 The code in this repo stays in sync with the `wireless-next` repository, with additional changes to accommodate kernel API changes over time.

📌 **Note**: The `wireless-next` repo contains the code set for the ***next*** kernel version. If kernel 6.X is out, kernel mainline repo is on 6.X+1-rcY, and `wireless-next` targets kernel 6.X+2 material.

---

## Compatibility
Compatible with **Linux kernel versions 5.4 and newer** as long as your distro hasn't modified any kernel APIs. RHEL and all distros based on RHEL will have modified kernel APIs and are unlikely to be compatible with this driver.


#### Supported Chipsets
- **PCIe**: RTL8723DE, RTL8821CE, RTL8822BE, RTL8822CE, RTL8814AE
- **SDIO**: RTL8723CS, RTL8723DS, RTL8821CS, RTL8822BS, RTL8822CS
- **USB** : RTL8723DU, RTL8811AU, RTL8811CU, RTL8812AU, RTL8812BU, RTL8812CU

## Issues 🚨
Report problems in Issues after you have checked the [Q&A](#qa) at bottom of this README.

⚠️ If you see a line such as:

`make[1]: *** /lib/modules/5.17.5-300.fc36.x86_64/build: No such file or directory.` **Stop.**

This indicates **you have NOT installed the kernel headers.** 

Use the following instructions for that step.

### Installation Using DKMS 🔄
Using DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) ensures that the `rtw88` kernel modules are automatically rebuilt and re-signed whenever the Linux kernel is updated on systems with secure boot enabled. Without DKMS, these drivers would stop working after each kernel update, requiring manual re-compilation and re-signing. DKMS should be available through your distribution’s package manager. You can learn more about DKMS [here](https://github.com/dell/dkms).

__Installation Process__
1. Install `dkms` and all its required dependencies using your preferred package manager.
2. Create a new Machine Owner Key (MOK).
    1. Generate a private RSA key.

        ```bash
        sudo openssl genrsa -out /var/lib/dkms/mok.key 2048
        ```

    2. Generate an X.509 certificate from the private key.

        ```bash
        sudo openssl req -new -x509 -key /var/lib/dkms/mok.key -outform DER -out /var/lib/dkms/mok.pub -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=DKMS Kernel Module Signing Key/"
        ```

    3. Enroll the certificate.

        ```bash
        sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/dkms/mok.pub
        ```

        Note: At this point, you will be requested to enter a password. Remember this password and re-enter it after rebooting your system in order to enrol your new MOK into your system's UEFI.

    4. Verify the new MOK was enrolled.

        ```bash
        mokutil --list-enrolled
        ```

3. Clone the `rtw88` GitHub repository to `/usr/src`.

    ```bash
    cd /usr/src && sudo git clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw88.git rtw88-0.6
    ```

4. Add `rtw88` to `dkms`.

    ```bash
    sudo dkms add -m rtw88 -v 0.6
    ```

5. Build and sign `rtw88` using your new MOK.

    ```bash
    sudo dkms build -m rtw88 -v 0.6
    ```

6. Install `rtw88`.

    ```bash
    sudo dkms install -m rtw88 -v 0.6
    ```

7. Verify `rtw88` was installed.

    ```bash
    dkms status
    ```

__Uninstallation Process__
```bash
sudo dkms remove -m rtw88 -v 0.6 --all # Remove rtw88 from dkms
sudo rm -r /var/lib/dkms/rtw88 # Remove rtw88 dkms build files (if they exist)
sudo make -C /usr/src/rtw88-0.6 uninstall # Run uninstall target in Makefile
sudo rm -r /usr/src/rtw88-0.6 # Remove cloned source code directory
```

```
```bash
cd rtw88
```
```bash
make
```
```bash
sudo make install_fw
```
```bash
sudo make sign-install
```
You will be prompted a password, **please keep it in mind and use it in next steps.**

Reboot to activate the new installed module, then in the MOK managerment screen:
1. Select "Enroll key" and enroll the key created by above sign-install step
2. When promted, enter the password you entered when create sign key. 
3. If you enter wrong password, your computer won't be bootable. In this case,
   use the BOOT menu from your BIOS, to boot into your OS then do below steps:
```bash
sudo mokutil --reset
```
- Restart your computer.
- Use BOOT menu from BIOS to boot into your OS.
- In the MOK managerment screen, select reset MOK list.
- Reboot then retry from the step `make sign-install`.

## Important Information
Below is important information for using this driver.

### 1. Blacklisting 🚫
A file called `blacklist-rtw88.conf` will be installed into `/etc/modprobe.d` when you run `sudo make install`. It will blacklist all in-kernel rtw88 drivers, however, it will not blacklist out-of-kernel vendor drivers. You will need to uninstall any out-of-kernel vendor drivers that you have installed that may conflict. `blacklist-rtw88.conf` will be removed when you run `sudo make uninstall`.

### 2. Recovery Problems After Sleep/Hibernation 🛌
Some BIOSs have trouble changing power state from D3hot to D0. If you have this problem, then:

``` bash
sudo cp suspend_rtw8822be /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/.
```

That script will unload the driver before sleep or hibernation, and reload it following resumption.
If you have some device other than the 8822be, edit the script before copying it.


### 3. How to Disable/Enable a Kernel Module 🪛
 ```bash
sudo modprobe -r rtw_8723de # This unloads the module
sudo modprobe -r rtw_core

# Due to some pecularities in the modprobe utility, two steps are required.

sudo modprobe rtw_8723de    # This loads the module

# Only a single modprobe call is required to load.
```

### 4. Kernel Updates 🔄
When your kernel updates, run:
```bash
cd ~/rtw88
```
Change the above to the location where you downloaded the driver if necessary.

```
git pull
```
```
make
```

```
sudo make install
or
sudo make sign-install
```




💡 **Remember, every newly installed kernel requires this step - no exceptions**. If the kernel update means that you have no network, skip the 'git pull' and build the driver as it is, but run `git pull` once you have connectivity, and rebuild if any updates were pulled.

## Q&A

---

### Q1: Is Secure Boot supported?
Yes, this repository provides a way to sign the kernel modules to be compatible with Secure Boot. [Check out the Installation with SecureBoot section](#installation-with-secureboot-for-all-distros-).

---

### Q2: How to remove this driver if it doesn't work as expected?
Run this command in the rtw88 source directory and then the rtw88 driver will be unloaded and removed.

`sudo make uninstall`

For Arch-based distro users, run

`sudo pacman -Rn rtw88-dkms-git`

---

### Q3: My wifi adapter is plugged in an USB 3 port, how can I keep it in USB 2 mode to avoid potential interference in 2.4 GHz band?
The module `rtw_usb` has a parameter named `switch_usb_mode` which can enable or disable USB mode switching, setting it to "N" will keep your adapter in USB 2 mode. You can simply run the command below, unplug the adapter, reboot your computer, replug the adapter back and then your adapter will be in USB 2 mode.

`sudo sh -c 'echo options rtw_usb switch_usb_mode=N > /etc/modprobe.d/rtw88.conf'`

---

### Q4: My wifi adapter still doesn't work after installing this driver and `lsusb` shows it is in CD-ROM mode, what should I do?
Install `usb_modeswitch` which can switch your adapter from CD-ROM mode to Wi-Fi mode and then your wifi adapter should be in Wi-Fi mode after reboot.

---

### Q5: My computer becomes very slow while building the driver, any idea to avoid that?
Run `make JOBS=x` instead, `x` is the number of compilation jobs that will be executed simultaneously, you can adjust it according to the CPU cores available on your machine.
